        Hello again!

    <div class="content">
        My name's Aditya Pandya. I was introduced to computers at the age of 14. I used to play a lot of games which
        eventually crashed the computer. My father instead of getting it repaired gave me the installation disk of 
        windows XP. I broke the copmuter several times and learnt to install operating systems.

        I started programming with c++ in my 11<sup>th</sup> grade. Mostly I used to copy the code from my friends,
        because it seemed pretty tough for me. I was bored writing normal programs like recursion, fibonacci series
        but i loved building projects. I learned so many concepts of DS and Algorithms by creating projects only.
